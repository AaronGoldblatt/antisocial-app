We need to create a smaller optimized banner image. Please follow these steps:

1. Download the existing banner.png
2. Use an image optimization tool to compress it to under 100KB
3. Save the optimized version as banner-small.png in the public directory
4. Update the header component to use this smaller image

This file is just a reminder - it needs manual intervention to actually create the optimized image.
