# AntiSocial

AntiSocial is a unique social media platform that flips the traditional social media model on its head. Instead of promoting positivity and happiness, AntiSocial encourages users to express their frustrations, annoyances, and negative thoughts.

## Core Concept

*"Where negativity is encouraged and positivity is tolerated (barely)."*

AntiSocial provides a refreshing contrast to conventional social platforms by creating a space where users can vent their frustrations without the pressure of maintaining a perfect online persona.

## Key Features

### Rants, Not Posts
Users create "rants" instead of posts, allowing them to express their deepest frustrations. The platform discourages sharing vacation photos or other traditionally "positive" content.

### Dislike-Driven Content
Content is ranked based on negative reactions:
- Content with more dislikes gets more visibility
- Super-dislikes give posts priority placement
- The platform features a "Most Disliked" sorting option

### Fresh Negativity
Users must post a rant before browsing, ensuring the platform maintains a steady stream of fresh complaints. This is enforced each time users log in.

### Reaction System
Three ways to express feelings:
- 👍 Like (for content you appreciate)
- 👎 Dislike (for content that annoys you)
- 🖕 Super Dislike (for content that truly offends you)

### Comments
Users can leave comments on rants, typically continuing the negative theme.

### Stalking Feature
Users can "stalk" other users to see their rants regularly in a dedicated feed called "Annoyances."

AntiSocial features a distinctive dark theme with orange/red accents that reinforces its contrarian attitude. Our angry dislike button mascot, Boo, visually represents the platform's focus on expressing negative emotions.

## Purpose

AntiSocial serves as a satirical commentary on traditional social media, providing a space where users can be authentic about their negative feelings rather than projecting an artificially positive image.
